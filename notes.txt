1. unsort data is not efficient in access.
2. sorting data is make efficient in access.

Algorithm means: whatever steps you have taken to sort the data.
[3,2,55,1,9]: unsort
[1,2,3,9,55]: sort

Data structure
-------------------
1. primitive (int,float,char,pointer etc.)
2. non primitie (array, list files)

List: Linear Lists: (Stacks, Queues)
List: non Linear: (Graphs, Tree)

1. linear (operation at starting or ending but not in middle)
2. non linear (anywhere in between we can perform op.)

Operations on Data Structure 
-----------------------------
1. Traversal 
2. Insertion
3. Deletion
4. Searching
5. sorting
6. Merging

Data structure to learn
-------------------------
1. Array
2. Stack
3. Queue 
4. Tree
5. Graph
6. Insertion 
7. Recursion
8. Search 
9. Sorting 
10. Merge 
11. Set 

Task1: 
Array Travering and Accessing 
-------------------------------------
1. Create HTML Page write basic array
2. Travering with loop
3. Accessing elements
4. Accessing element with text input and button
5. Validations 


Task2:
Insert Element in Array
-------------------------
1. Understand issue and solution with Whiteboard
2. Make array, define the position
3. Use Loop to insert new element
4. Insert element with text input and button
5. Insert element with by default function



Task3:
Searc Element in Array 
-------------------------
1. understand case and solution with Whiteboard
2. make array 
3. use loop to search element 
4. search element with text input and button
    *   shortcut for search element(default functoion)
    *   shortcut for delete element(default function)


Tas4:
Merge Two Array
------------------
1. understand case and solution with Whiteboard
2. make three arrays
3. use 2 different loops to merge element 
    *   shortcut for reverse array element(default function)
    *   shortcut for merge array(default function)


Task5: (incomplete)
Merge Two Array(while Loop)
-----------------------------
1. understand case and solution with whiteboard 
2. make three arrays
3. use while loop to merge element 
    *   compare this logic with last one


Task6
Alorithmn Complexity
------------------------
1. algorithm basics
2. what is algorithm complexity
3. time complexity
    * the time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution.

4. space complexity
    *   space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
    *   space complexity = auxiliary space + input size

5. Big O notation (use to denote complexity(time/space))
